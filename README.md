# GoodLife Pulse Tracker

GoodLife Pulse Tracker is a web application for finding GoodLife Fitness clubs in the Calgary area (and later other locations) and checking their estimated crowd level before visiting.

The product focuses on quick club discovery, estimated occupancy visibility, user-submitted crowd reports, and saved favorite locations.

Crowd levels are application estimates based on user reports and system logic. They should not be presented as official GoodLife Fitness capacity data unless an official data integration is added later.
